# Smart Word Count 

Google Doc Add-On that allows you to count words properly using suggestions (as if suggestions were accepted!)

## What Is It?

Normally when counting words via Google Docs, any suggestions you've made are ignored.

This can make it frustrating to accurately calculate word count based on your suggested edits.

Whether you are a professional editor, student, teacher, or just need to calculate word count as if suggestions were accepted, Smart Word Count is made for you.

## How to Use

1. Install the Add-On

2. Select text on your document that you'd like to count words for. If no text is selected, the entire document will be used for word count.

3. Click `Smart Word Count` in the dropdown, then `Show Word Count`

4. You will see the word count for your selection as if all suggestions have been accepted.
